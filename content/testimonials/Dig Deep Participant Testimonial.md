name = "Dig Deep Participant Testimonial"
testimonial_text = "The first day is an hour: of nervous laughs, frustration because you are the only one not able to get in the poses, being completely exhausted from working so hard to keep your barriers up, and hiding your authentic self from your classmates. But as the weeks pass, your classmates become your fellow yogis and your biggest supporters! The poses become a thought of the past as your inner barriers fade away....and the practice takes over.  The Breathing, the Modifications, the Self-Acceptance This is my 'Dig Deep.'"
