description = "Are you looking to take your yoga practice further than just your postures and breathwork? Then this Dig Deep is perfect for YOU! Join me as we work on the first 2 limbs of the yoga practice; the Yamas & Niyamas. These are ethical guidelines of the practice. Practices such as contentment, discipline, non stealing, and more. For the first 5 weeks of this 6 week series we will learn how to live 1 Yama & 1 Niyama both on and off the mat. In the final week we will put them all together and reflect on the previous 5 weeks."
