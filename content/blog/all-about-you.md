**Hey Lovely,**

So far the journey has led us straight to YOU.

Today it’s all about YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yoga students are a diverse group of people coming from all walks of life, socio economic backgrounds, gender, race, skin color, religious beliefs, and the hundreds if not thousands of other ways we can group ourselves.

In my years of practicing and teaching yoga I have found that three characteristics stand out.

YOU are TEACHABLE....... You come to class with an open heart and open mind. You come ready to soak in the teachings of yoga with humility and  you are so eager to learn.

YOU are HARDWORKING.... You are dedicated to coming to your mat and committed to giving it your best. You meet the struggle with grace and press on through the challenges. Because of it you also reap the rewards.

YOU are KIND.... Both to yourself and to others. You are gentle with yourself and offer support to your fellow yogis. You offer no judgement. One of my favorite things in class is when I see a new student be greeted and tended to by a regular. You are really good at that.

YOU make yoga a community. What a beautiful family I have the pleasure to witness, be a part of,  and serve. You make Sacred Space a Sacred Space.

But why practice yoga in the first place?

Next let’s look at some of the benefits that attract us to this practice.

**Blessings and Namaste,
