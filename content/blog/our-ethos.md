**Hey Lovely,**

_Welcome to Sacred Space. I am so glad you are here and I can't wait to learn a little bit more about you._

_In the meantime, can I share with you a little bit about Sacred Space?_

_The ethos of Sacred Space, the thing that drives us and keeps us moving forward has been on my heart long enough and I am so ready to share it with you. It is only a sentence long, but it’s a powerful one._

_It is this:_

_"For those who want to feel at home in their bodies, Sacred Space provides a therapeutic approach through different modalities that integrates the mind, body, and Spirit."_

_Simple, right?_

_Yet so Powerful! Especially in the times we are living in. We all want to feel a sense of safety and it starts in our own bodies._

_This statement informs every decision we make, every class we teach, every interaction we have, every social media post, every product._

_This statement brings clarity to what we are here to do._

_I hope to continue to share with you this mission, to bring transparency to who Sacred Space is and what we do. And my ultimate goal is that you too would join us as we journey to live a life we love in and through service._

_I hope you learned a little about us today and I look forward to sharing more with you in the coming weeks._

**Blessings and Namaste,**  
Angel Coughlin
