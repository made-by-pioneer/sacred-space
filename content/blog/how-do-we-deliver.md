**Hey lovely,**

Today I want to talk to you about the HOW.

How we do what we do. How we serve. How we reach people. How we affect people and effect change.

Letâ€™s go back to that number 3.

Here are three ways Sacred Space is answering those questions on HOW.

We offer EDUCATION. Our classes are more than teacher led movements. Every teacher seeks to ignite and inspire the learning process within the student. This leads to a lifetime of curiosity and growth. The adage about teaching a man to fish is so apt here. As yoga teachers, the goal is to equip the student to be able to fish themselves. We help students navigate as they develop agency.

We do this in a way that is RELATABLE.. Yoga is a practice for on and off the mat. We learn and explore on the mat concepts we put into practice in our daily living. We honor this beautiful practice of yoga and the process of sharing it in a way that makes sense and its applicable to our lives.

Perhaps the most impactful way we deliver (in my mind) is BREVITY. There is so much stimuli out there constantly bombarding us. We promise to not add to the noise. We say what we mean and mean what we say. We promise to be concise in our delivery  and to give you space to have and digest your own experience.

We deliver by being educational, relatable, and concise.

Next I would love to share what our community has to say.

**Blessings and Namaste,**  
Angel Coughlin
