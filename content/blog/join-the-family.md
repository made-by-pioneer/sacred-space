Hey Lovely,  
  
Wow. It's been a few weeks of learning and growing together. We talked a little about who Sacred Space is, what we do, and how we do it.  
  
I have one more secret to share with you.  
  
Ok, so it’s not really a secret but in case you didn’t know, here it is.  
  
Sacred Space is one big family. We do life together, share space together, hurt, and heal together.  
  
We support one another and our community. We each do our part and we all thrive because of it.  
Did you know that your membership and donations help support Sacred Service programs?  
Sacred Service programs allow us to offer no-cost, low cost, and donation-based classes to the community, especially underserved populations such as addiction and recovery, veterans, seniors, and differently-abled children, women of color, Latino populations.  
  
When you join the Sacred Space family through your membership purchase you are joining a network of caring hands that together are building a more wholesome and unified community.  
  
Consider a membership or donation today and feel good about your yoga practice while also supporting your neighbors.  
  
Blessings and Namaste
