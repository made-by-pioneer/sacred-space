Hey Lovely,  
  
Today we chat about the benefits of yoga.  
Play along with me for a moment as I ask you some questions?  
  
Have you ever taken a vinyasa or energetic class and felt so spent in savasana but then the whole day you are full of energy?  
  
Have you ever done a mindful flow or movement and meditation class and felt so relaxed you were able to get great sleep that night?  
  
Have you ever felt clear-minded or grounded after a class?  
  
What about this one?  
  
Have you ever left a yoga class feeling both energized AND relaxed at the same time?  
  
Mind-boggling, right?  
  
I am willing to bet you answered yes to at least one of these questions.  
  
What you experienced are some of the benefits to a yoga practice: energy, relaxation, equanimity.  
The benefits can often be felt immediately. They can also have a long-lasting effect.  
  
The questions today highlighted the immediate and recognizable impact.  
  
Next, we look at the long-lasting impact of yoga.  
  
Blessings and Namaste,
