Hey Lovely,  
  
Today we chat about the tangible and long-lasting impact of a yoga practice.  
  
Let's start by revisiting our Ethos: "For those who want to feel at home in their bodies, Sacred Space provides a therapeutic approach through different modalities that integrate to the mind, body, and Spirit."  
  
That first part is so important; "For those who want to feel at home in their bodies."  
  
This is it. But, how do we do this?  
  
By cultivating a relationship with ourselves. Reducing stress. Regulating the nervous system.  
  
The practice of yoga helps us to become aware and acquainted with our bodies. We begin to move and breathe more organically which reduces the levels of physical and mental stress on the body. This back and forth of effort and ease is helping our nervous system fluidly move through the sympathetic and parasympathetic states and therefore stimulating proper regulation.  
  
The impacts of a sustained yoga practice are many. It's called a practice for a reason.  
  
We are here for the long haul. We are here to do life together and to link arms with one another as we journey on to better living through better health.  
  
Next, we consider what sets Sacred Space apart, and why we are radically different.  
  
Blessings and Namaste
