question = "I'm not flexible.​​"
answer = "Clinically this is an impossibility. Everyone is flexible just to different degrees. But we understand. Maybe you can’t touch your toes or can’t do the splits.

Yoga is about the journey, about what you learn on the way down to reach your toes. Whether you ever arrive is inconsequential."
