question = "How is yoga different?​"
answer = "Many western traditions view yoga as yet another form of fitness and exercise. At Sacred Space we hold true to the more traditional approach to yoga. Yoga means to “yoke” or unite. Yoga offers a way to unite body, mind, and spirit through practices such as asana (movement), breath work (pranayama), and meditation (dyana). We are complex beings and the practice of yoga allows for a person to find connection between the different aspects of their being. When balance is experienced healing and wholeness take place."
